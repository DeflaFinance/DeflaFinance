## Buy-Back and Burn.
Buyback-and-burn programs support long term price stability and value growth; that’s why DEFA has included it into the $DFLA token’s smart contract.
BuyBack DEFLA team will buy back $DFLA tokens from the open market every month and burn those purchased tokens via a smart contract. With each buyback-and-burn, the net asset value of DFLA’s Blockchain Asset Pool will be divided among a shrinking supply of tokens in circulation. As a result, the price of the $DFLA token should continuously grow over time.
Growth DEFLA team will spend 20% of annual operating profits — calculated as trading profit less trading and operating costs and tax — to buyback-and-burn tokens. The token’s smart contract includes a commitment to buyback-and-burn 10% of the total amount of tokens issued, which is expected to have positive short-term and long-term effects on the $DFLA token’s price appreciation.
